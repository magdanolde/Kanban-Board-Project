## KANBAN BOARD 

### :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

Kanban work methodology is used widely in many companies. It is often related to when Agile is not efficient or impossible to introduce. You can read more about Kanban 
[here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban).

### :unlock: FEATURES 

The Kanban Board enables to:

* Create tasks with a detailed description;
* Move defined tasks between columns with defined limits;
* Save tasks to Local Storage so you don't miss them when you close your app;

###  SOLUTIONS APPLIED IN THE PROJECT

* React Hooks and Context API
* LocalStorage -> I created my custom hook called useStorage to handle data saving. Data is uploaded from localStorage as soon as the Kanban Board is mounted. Tasks are 
saved when the explorer tab is going to be closed.
* UI desined in a minimalistic way

###  SOLUTIONS I STILL WANT TO ADD 

* Mobile & tablet version

### :boom: PROJECT LIVE 

The project uses node, npm, webpack and compiler babel as well as package JSON-server.

Having them installed, type into the terminal:

npm i

Then, you may run webpack typing in the terminal:

npm start
